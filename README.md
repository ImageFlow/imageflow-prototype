imageflow-prototype
===================

A working responsive prototype of the new WordPress Image Flow - no integration with WordPress data.

We'll be exploring the following scenarios:

1. User Adds New Image To Post (edited)

2. User Adds Existing Image to Post

3. User Edits Existing Image and Adds It To Post

4. User Creates A Gallery

5. User Inserts Multiple Pieces Into Post

6. User Edits Image that is already inserted
